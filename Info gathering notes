1.	Ted von Hippel 2005 (review) Galactic Open Clusters
Why open clusters are important: connected to stellar evolution, which is important
Provides one of the most precise stellar ages.
Open clusters are mostly found in the galactic plane (as expected)
Database of clusters: Jean-Claude Mermilliod’s excellent website, http://obswww.unige.ch/webda/
Age distribution of these clusters: Salaris, Weiss, & Percival (2004).
Open clusters show no obvious age-metallicity relation (e.g., Janes 1979;
Friel 1995), but they do show a metallicity gradient as a function of Galactocentric
distance (e.g., Salaris et al. 2004).
Since open clusters dissolve readily, the oldest open clusters place only a
lower limit on the age of the Galactic disk.
NGC 6791 and Be 17 being ∼10 Gyr (Salaris et al. 2004)

2.	A. L. Tadross 2014 The astrophysical behavior of open clusters along the Milky Way Galaxy
A table that includes age of a large number of clusters
A general look at the positions of open clusters in the milky way galaxy, and the spread regarding the distance from the galactic plane, and distance from the galactic centre.
Did some constraints to cluster size and R_lim (don’t know what this is)
Linear size of open clusters increases with ages
